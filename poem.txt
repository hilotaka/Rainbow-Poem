The Rainbow and the Unicorn and the Pony

Today is Earth Day.
He said : "I love Earth Day."
Earth Day is my favorite color.
Purple rain
is not pink
is not orange either
Blue is cold
Teal
Green is calm
Brown 
Indigo
Clouds
Unicorn
Yellow, the color of the best-known plasma sphere
Red is hot
East or West Dannie is the best!
These are the colors of the rainbow.
And the rainbow coloured unicorn.
Pony:
Peter Pony drinks a cup of oolong tea.
It tastes wonderful.
There must have been some cicadas on those leaves, how lucky!
Learning with shiffman is like looking at a beautiful rainbow everyday.
Like the rainbow after storm in New York the other day.
Let's dance.
